        I deeply regret not being more mindful of how my words could affect you.
        Instead of preventing the situation, I ended up making it worse.
        I never meant to hurt you, but I know my words did, and for that, I am truly sorry.
        It breaks my heart knowing that I was the reason for your pain and tears.
        I feel disappointed in myself for not thinking carefully before speaking,
